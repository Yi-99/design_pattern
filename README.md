# design_pattern

# Singleton

## Advantages
* One global instantiation of a class to manage global state in an application
* Save significant potential memory space

## Disadvantages
* Considered as an anti-pattern and should be avoided in Javascript
* Mutable nature of global state makes the application prone to global scope pollution, in other words, danger of the value being changed in unexpected ways.
